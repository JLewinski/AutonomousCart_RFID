  Reading multiple RFID tags, simultaneously!

  To kill a tag the tag's kill password must be set. When tags are shipped their passwords
  are set to 0x00000000. See the Write_Passwords example to write access and kill passwords.
  
  Obviously, be careful because this premanently and irrevocably destroys a tag.

  This shows how to send the right command (with password) to disable a tag.
