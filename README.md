# AutonomousCart_RFID
This is a Spring 2019 Senior Design Project at Auburn University

## Getting started:

1. Download and install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Install the [PlatformIO IDE](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide/vscode.html) extension for VS Code

3. You will need to add 2 libraries to PlatformIO:
  1. [Ultrasonic-HC-SR04 by Bruno Peixoto](https://github.com/brunolnetto/Ultrasonic-HC-SR04?utm_source=platformio&utm_medium=piohome)
  2. [SparkFun Simultaneous RFID Tag Reader Library by SparkFun Electronics](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Simultaneous_RFID_Tag_Reader_Library?utm_source=platformio&utm_medium=piohome)

4. Clone this repo into VS Code

NOTE: If you want to commit directly to the repo you will have to get a Github account and I will have to set you up and show you how I want you to do it.
