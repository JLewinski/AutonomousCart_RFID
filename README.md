This is a Spring 2019 Senior Design Project at Auburn University

## Getting started:

Download and install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
Install the [PlatformIO IDE](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide/vscode.html) extension for VS Code
You may need to start a free trial with PlatformIO.

Clone this repo into VS Code (easily done with [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/))

If you want to commit directly to the repo you will have to get a Github account and I will have to set you up and show you how I want you to do it.
